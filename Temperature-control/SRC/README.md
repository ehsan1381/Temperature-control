# Documentation

This project has many features which can be modified for your use. The C preprocessor is the easiest way to modify your project. After any editing in the C file it needs to be compiled again with Codevision so it is recommended that you only edit it if you have the skills to modify Codevision projects and compile the file again. Or you can make a request in this repo so that [developer](https://github.org/ehsan1381/) adds your own compiled configuration to this repository. The default circuit is available in the repository as a proteus project and an image. Both are the same and there is no diffrence. Also note that this project is open source and you can use it and edit it in any way you want and there is no limit except dont forget to mention [developers account](https://github.org/ehsan1381/)
