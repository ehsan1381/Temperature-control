# AVR TEMP CONTROL

[Codevision](http://www.hpinfotech.ro/)

The Temperature Control program is written in C language specially for AVR microcontrollers. This code is written with CodeVision C Compiler and is easily compiled with it and the project is also included so there is no need fo you to create another project. The repository also contains Visual Studio solution and project file but they have nothing to do with the compile or anything else since CodeVision is just used as a simple compiler and not to edit or write code. (Visual Studio is definately better)
